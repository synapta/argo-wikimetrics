# wikimetrics
This is a collection of tools for extracting metrics from the wiki world

## Goal

The goal is to provide a tool that can be used to find users with a specific geographical focus, often related their full-time or temporary (familiar, free time or professional) residence. 

This will improve the network of users related to a specific geographical area and create a much close-knit community.

## Impact

The impact is a more effective community networking, both for onwiki or offwiki activities. Users with a very strong geographical background can be contacted to help with content creation (missing images, sources in local library) and to boost the territorial presence of Wikimedia initiatives, sometimes allowing lower costs and bigger efficiency. You can get an insight of a specific place (better facilities or contacts in the local administration) in a much direct way if you can find someone on wiki who knows it already.
